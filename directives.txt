DIRECTIVES

Hilary and Keith

Directives are basically the jsp version of an import statement.
They are useful for code that can be re-used.

You can import a package or another jsp file.
The benefit of importing a package is that you are able to use 
anything from the package without qualifying it with class
names.

Syntax: <%@ page ... %> 
        <%@ include ... %>

1. Package import example:
Note: java.util* is being imported so that the Date() function
does not need to be qualified with class names when 
it is used.
--------------------------------
<%@ page import="java.util.*" %>

<html>
    <head>
        <title>Package Import Example</title>
    </head>

    <body>
        <p>
            Current Date: <%= new Date() %>
        </p>
    </body>
<html>
------------------------------------

2. Other jsp file import example
Note: The jsp file (code from above) will be 
imported to the code below.

<html>
    <head>
        <title>Other JSP File Import Example</title>
    </head>

    <body>
        <p>
            The import statement will display everything
            from the first example here:
            <%@ include file="packageImportExample.jsp" %>
        </p>
    </body>
<html>
